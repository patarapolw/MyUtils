# MyUtils

Collection of utility files. Also, to clean my (author's) projects of duplicated useful files.

## Installation

```commandline
pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/patarapolw/MyUtils.git#egg=MyUtils --dev
```

Or use `pip`.

Or just clone this project, and copy files manually as you need. (That's what I do too!)
